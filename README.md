simulation of a smart home-oriented zigbee network

This work aims to evaluate the performance of a wireless sensor network, based on
a Smart Home architecture for the monitoring and management of energy
consumption using a Zigbee network, proposed by Souto and Alfaia (2016). The
study was conducted using modeling and simulation techniques. Three scenarios
were created, whose difference is the increase in the number of sensor nodes, in
order to analyze both the behavior of the network and coordinating node with the
traffic growth. At the end of the study, the results obtained with the OPNETÂ©
simulator showed that the Zigbee protocol is feasible for the Smart Home application,
since despite the increase in network traffic caused by the increase in the number of
final devices, the network performance was not affected significantly.
